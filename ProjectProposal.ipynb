The questino is important because it will help us focus how can we develope streets to be safer and what should we prioritize while making streets safer (lighting vs potholes).\n",

If our key insights work out, the city of San Diego can provide live time collision data and analysis similar to our second reference (TIMS).\n",

This data could help drivers in the area, since we will be able to identify streets where incidents frequently occur, and could potentially be used with some sort of GPS, like Google Maps to notify the driver of such streets. Most importantly, it has the potential to inspire change to allow San Diego to be a safer place for drivers.\n",

One potential problem is that the dataset we are using is not entirely representative of all incidents, since these reports are generally only taken when related to DUI or hit and run. Another issue could be that the collisions dataset alone might be difficult to understand why the streets cause accidents, so another dataset with more details of these streets may be needed to continue this project."
